# Intro

We provide several tutorials that help explain how to work with the system.

Check out [Food Data Transformation Tutorial](transform-food/intro) to know how the system can be used for transformation of structured data (e.g. JSON) to RDF. It features a detailed description of the features of the user interface and how they can be used to transform data to RDF.

There are also some advanced tutorials focused for adding recommendation methods and uploading data to the app to be used in recommendations in the advanced section.
