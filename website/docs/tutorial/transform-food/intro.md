# Intro

In this tutorial we showcase the Klofan system by describing how to represent real food data in JSON from [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) to RDF using the system. You can either use the [live editor](https://klofan.linkedpipes.com/editor) or run the app locally. Running the app locally guarantees having exactly the same behaviour as in the tutorial since we run it with the same underlying data as in the tutorial. On the other hand, the live instance can be slightly different since it is probably running using more underlying data.
