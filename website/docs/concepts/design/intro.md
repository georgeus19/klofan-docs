# Intro

In this chapter, we design a system based on our proposed approach from
Analysis (). First we identify the main components of the system and how
they should interact with each other based on the proposed approach.
Based on these components we design the architecture of the system.
Lastly, we look at how to represent user's structured data.

We iteratively analyze and design the system. Both the architectural and
data representation sections introduce the requirements based on which
the architecture or data representation are designed. These requirements
are typically influenced by some design decisions made in the previous
sections or chapters; therefore, we do not employ the classical approach
of defining all system requirements beforehand.
